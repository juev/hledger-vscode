; === MANUAL TESTING GUIDELINES ===
;
; To test the strict completion system manually:
;
; 1. DATE COMPLETION:
;    - Place cursor at beginning of any line and type digits
;    - Should get date suggestions via 24x7 IntelliSense
;    - Try typing "0" at line start - should get zero-based month suggestions
;    - Try Ctrl+Alt+D (manual date completion command)
;
; 2. ACCOUNT COMPLETION:
;    - Place cursor on indented lines and type letters
;    - Should get account suggestions via 24x7 IntelliSense
;    - Type ":" after account name - should trigger account hierarchy completion
;    - Try Ctrl+Alt+A (manual account completion command)
;
; 3. COMMODITY COMPLETION:
;    - Place cursor after amount + single space and type letters
;    - Should get commodity suggestions via 24x7 IntelliSense
;    - Type "@" for commodity trading syntax - should trigger commodity completion
;
; 4. FORBIDDEN ZONES:
;    - Try typing after amounts + two spaces - should get NO completions
;    - Try typing in middle of existing words - should get NO completions
;    - Try Ctrl+Space in forbidden areas - should still work (manual override)
;
; 5. TRIGGER VERIFICATION:
;    - Only ":", "@", ";" should be registered as explicit triggers
;    - All other completions should come from 24x7 IntelliSense
;    - Verify ~80% reduction in false trigger events compared to old system
